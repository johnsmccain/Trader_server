# Backend - Trivia API

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Node js v18** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of node for your platform.
   
2. **node --version** to confirm which version is install on your platform.
   

2. **npm Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/Trader-server` directory and running:

```bash
npm install 
```

#### Key npm Dependencies

- Express is required to handle requests and responses.

- Mongodb database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- CORS is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.


### Run the Server


To run the server, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```


## To Do Tasks

These are the files you'd want to edit in the backend:

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py`
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`

One note before you delve into your tasks: for each endpoint, you are expected to define the endpoint and response data. The frontend will be a plentiful resource because it is set up to expect certain endpoints and response data formats already. You should feel free to specify endpoints in your own way; if you do so, make sure to update the frontend or you will get some unexpected behavior.

1. Use Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests and set response headers.
2. Create an endpoint to handle `GET` requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint should return a list of questions, number of total questions, current category, categories.
3. Create an endpoint to handle `GET` requests for all available categories.
4. Create an endpoint to `DELETE` a question using a question `ID`.
5. Create an endpoint to `POST` a new question, which will require the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score.
6. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on category.
7. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It should return any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question.
8. Create a `POST` endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint should take a category and previous question parameters and return a random questions within the given category, if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions.
9. Create error handlers for all expected errors including 400, 404, 422, and 500.

## Documenting your Endpoints

You will need to provide detailed documentation of your API endpoints including the URL, request parameters, and the response body. Use the example below as a reference.

### Documentation:

`GET '/categories'`

Write at least one test for the success and at least one error behavior of each endpoint using the unittest library.

To deploy the tests, run
